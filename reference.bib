Each substitution has the potential to affect protein function. SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) is a program that predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function so that users can prioritize substitutions for further study. We have shown that SIFT can distinguish between functionally neutral and deleterious amino acid changes in mutagenesis studies and on human polymorphisms.

	abstract = {Predicting ﬁtness in natural populations is a major challenge in biology. It may be possible to leverage fast-accumulating genomic data sets to infer the ﬁtness effects of mutant alleles, allowing evolutionary questions to be addressed in any organism. In this paper, we investigate the utility of one such tool, called PROVEAN. This program compares a query sequence with existing data to provide an alignment-based score for any protein variant, with scores categorized as neutral or deleterious based on a pre-set threshold. PROVEAN has been used widely in evolutionary studies, for example, to estimate mutation load in natural populations, but has not been formally tested as a predictor of aggregate mutational effects on ﬁtness. Using three large published data sets on the genome sequences of laboratory mutation accumulation lines, we assessed how well PROVEAN predicted the actual ﬁtness patterns observed, relative to other metrics. In most cases, we ﬁnd that a simple count of the total number of mutant proteins is a better predictor of ﬁtness than the number of proteins with variants scored as deleterious by PROVEAN. We also ﬁnd that the sum of all mutant protein scores explains variation in ﬁtness better than the number of mutant proteins in one of the data sets. We discuss the implications of these results for studies of populations in the wild.},

This stands in stark contrast with our limited ability to interpret the sequence variants which we find. Although it is, perhaps, easiest to interpret variants in coding regions, knowledge of functional impact is unknown for the vast majority of missense variants. While many computational approaches can predict the impact of coding variants, they are given a little weight in the current guidelines for interpreting clinical variants. Laboratory assays produce comparatively more trustworthy results, but until recently did not scale to the space of all possible mutations. The development of deep mutational scanning and other multiplexed assays of variant effect has now brought feasibility of this endeavour within view. Here, we review progress in this field over the last decade, break down the different approaches into their components, and compare methodological differences.},

Genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 gene frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on the molecular function of the BRCA1 protein is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for homology directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a key activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay to simultaneously measure the effect of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 on its role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we measured the effects of ~1,700 amino acid substitutions in the first 302 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.},

Here, we describe three pediatric cases of cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death with variants of uncertain significance in calmodulin genes.

These are crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, metabolism and signalling, as well as the availability of cellular energy. Very stable, but also rather transient and dynamic proteinprotein interactions generate new system properties at the level of multiprotein complexes, cellular compartments or the entire cell. Thus, interactomics is expected to largely contribute to emerging fields like systems biology or systems bioenergetics. The more recent technological development of high-throughput methods for interactomics research will dramatically increase our knowledge of protein interaction networks. The two most frequently used methods are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, a well established genetic in vivo approach, and affinity purification of complexes followed by mass spectrometry analysis, an emerging biochemical in vitro technique. So far, a majority of published interactions have been detected using an Y2H screen. However, with the massive application of this method, also some limitations have become apparent. This review provides an overview on available yeast two-hybrid methods, in particular focusing on more recent approaches. These allow detection of protein interactions in their native environment, as e.g. in the cytosol or bound to a membrane, by using cytosolic signalling cascades or split protein constructs. Strengths and weaknesses of these genetic methods are discussed and some guidelines for verification of detected protein-protein interactions are provided.},

	abstract = {Background: PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor protein regulating cell growth, immune signaling, neuronal function, and genome stability. Experimental characterization can help guide the clinical interpretation of the thousands of germline or somatic PTEN variants observed in patients. Two large-scale mutational datasets, one for PTEN variant intracellular abundance encompassing 4112 missense variants and one for lipid phosphatase activity encompassing 7244 variants, were recently published. The combined information from these datasets can reveal variant-specific phenotypes that may underlie various clinical presentations, but this has not been comprehensively examined, particularly for somatic PTEN variants observed in cancers.
Methods: Here, we add to these efforts by measuring the intracellular abundance of 764 new PTEN variants and refining abundance measurements for 3351 previously studied variants. We use this expanded and refined PTEN abundance dataset to explore the mutational patterns governing PTEN intracellular abundance, and then incorporate the phosphatase activity data to subdivide PTEN variants into four functionally distinct groups.
Results: This analysis revealed a set of highly abundant but lipid phosphatase defective variants that could act in a dominant-negative fashion to suppress PTEN activity. Two of these variants were, indeed, capable of dysregulating Akt signaling in cells harboring a WT PTEN allele. Both variants were observed in multiple breast or uterine tumors, demonstrating the disease relevance of these high abundance, inactive variants.
Conclusions: We show that multidimensional, large-scale variant functional data, when paired with public cancer genomics datasets and follow-up assays, can improve understanding of uncharacterized cancer-associated variants, and provide better insights into how they contribute to oncogenesis.},

	abstract = {Most rare clinical missense variants cannot currently be classiﬁed as pathogenic or benign. Deﬁciency in human 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the most common inherited disorder of folate metabolism, is caused primarily by rare missense variants. Further complicating variant interpretation, variant impacts often depend on environment. An important example of this phenomenon is the MTHFR variant p.Ala222Val (c.665C{\textgreater}T), which is carried by half of all humans and has a phenotypic impact that depends on dietary folate. Here we describe the results of 98,336 variant functional-impact assays, covering nearly all possible MTHFR amino acid substitutions in four folinate environments, each in the presence and absence of p.Ala222Val. The resulting atlas of MTHFR variant effects reveals many complex dependencies on both folinate and p.Ala222Val. MTHFR atlas scores can distinguish pathogenic from benign variants and, among individuals with severe MTHFR deﬁciency, correlate with age of disease onset. Providing a powerful tool for understanding structure-function relationships, the atlas suggests a role for a disordered loop in retaining cofactor at the active site and identiﬁes variants that enable escape of inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine. Thus, a model based on eight MTHFR variant effect maps illustrates how shifting landscapes of environment- and genetic-background-dependent missense variation can inform our clinical, structural, and functional understanding of MTHFR deﬁciency.},

	abstract = {Recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/ AMP) for interpreting sequence variants specify the use of computational predictors as ‘‘supporting’’ level of evidence for pathogenicity or benignity using criteria PP3 and BP4, respectively. However, score intervals deﬁned by tool developers, and ACMG/AMP recommendations that require the consensus of multiple predictors, lack quantitative support. Previously, we described a probabilistic framework that quantiﬁed the strengths of evidence (supporting, moderate, strong, very strong) within ACMG/AMP recommendations. We have extended this framework to computational predictors and introduce a new standard that converts a tool’s scores to PP3 and BP4 evidence strengths. Our approach is based on estimating the local positive predictive value and can calibrate any computational tool or other continuous-scale evidence on any variant type. We estimate thresholds (score intervals) corresponding to each strength of evidence for pathogenicity and benignity for thirteen missense variant interpretation tools, using carefully assembled independent data sets. Most tools achieved supporting evidence level for both pathogenic and benign classiﬁcation using newly established thresholds. Multiple tools reached score thresholds justifying moderate and several reached strong evidence levels. One tool reached very strong evidence level for benign classiﬁcation on some variants. Based on these ﬁndings, we provide recommendations for evidence-based revisions of the PP3 and BP4 ACMG/AMP criteria using individual tools and future assessment of computational methods for clinical interpretation.},

            Clinicians and software developers need to understand how proposed machine learning (ML) models could improve patient care. No single metric captures all the desirable properties of a model, which is why several metrics are typically reported to summarize a model’s performance. Unfortunately, these measures are not easily understandable by many clinicians. Moreover, comparison of models across studies in an objective manner is challenging, and no tool exists to compare models using the same performance metrics. This paper looks at previous ML studies done in gastroenterology, provides an explanation of what different metrics mean in the context of binary classification in the presented studies, and gives a thorough explanation of how different metrics should be interpreted. We also release an open source web-based tool that may be used to aid in calculating the most relevant metrics presented in this paper so that other researchers and clinicians may easily incorporate them into their research.},

ClinVar recently started accepting submissions that are focused primarily on providing phenotypic information for individuals who have had genetic testing. Submissions may come from clinical providers providing their own interpretation of the variant (‘provider interpretation’) or from groups such as patient registries that primarily provide phenotypic information from patients (‘phenotyping only’).

	abstract = {The depletion of disruptive variation caused by purifying natural selection (constraint) has been widely used to investigate protein-coding genes underlying human disorders, but attempts to assess constraint for non-protein-coding regions have proven more difficult. Here we aggregate, process, and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), the largest public open-access human genome reference dataset, and use this dataset to build a mutational constraint map for the whole genome. We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation across the genome. As expected, proteincoding sequences overall are under stronger constraint than non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association, and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, while non-coding constraint captures additional functional information underrecognized by gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map provides an effective approach for characterizing the non-coding genome and improving the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The recently discovered small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 belongs to the growing family of ubiquitin-related proteins involved in postranslational protein modification. Unlike ubiquitin, SUMO-1 does not appear to target proteins for degradation but seems to be involved in the modulation of protein-protein interactions. Independent studies demonstrate an essential function of SUMO-1 in the regulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, and suggest a role in cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. Here, we present the first three-dimensional structure of SUMO-1 solved by NMR. Although having only 18% amino acid sequence identity with ubiquitin, the overall structure closely resembles that of ubiquitin, featuring the ββαββαβ fold of the ubiquitin protein family. In addition, the position of the two C-terminal Gly residues required for isopeptide bond formation is conserved between ubiquitin and SUMO-1. The most prominent feature of SUMO-1 is a long and highly flexible N terminus, which protrudes from the core of the protein and which is absent in ubiquitin. Furthermore, ubiquitin Lys48, required to generate ubiquitin polymers, is substituted in SUMO-1 by Gln69 at the same position, which provides an explanation of why SUMO-1 has not been observed to form polymers. Moreover, the hydrophobic core of SUMO-1 and ubiquitin is maintained by conserved hydrophobic residues, whereas the overall charge topology of SUMO-1 and ubiquitin differs significantly, suggesting specific modifying enzymes and target proteins for both proteins.}
